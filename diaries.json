It's the kind of quiet sadness that doesn't demand attention, but simply absorbs the color out of the day.

I keep reminding myself that feelings, like the weather, are temporary, yet the prospect of waiting for the sun to break through feels exhausting right now.\r\n\r\nI tried to combat the slump earlier by going for a walk, hoping the fresh air and change of scenery would help, but it just ended up confirming my internal state. The streets seemed ordinary, the people rushed and preoccupied, and I felt utterly detached, like a silent observer in my own life. I spent the evening staring at the ceiling, thinking about all the things I should be doing versus what I actually felt capable of, which was nothing much at all. It’s frustrating to have a mind full of ambitions but a spirit too heavy to execute them. I suppose all I can do is acknowledge this feeling, not try to force a change, and hope that tomorrow brings a slightly lighter step.
